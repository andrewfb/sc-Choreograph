sc-Choreograph
A simple animation and timing library intended for use with the Cinder framework. Initial inspiration came from the TweenMax library for AS3.

Status
Tweens and Cues are part of a Sequence, which is the primary interface for users
Templated tweens support all types which implement + and * operations
Cues can call any boost::function<void ()> at a chosen point in the Sequence
Easing functions integrated, and can be used as a stand-alone module
Memory management through shared_ptr
Flexible step() method allows for user-controlled time

Untested
Sequences can be nested in each other

To Do:
callbacks on tween complete
Looping, ping-ponging, and reversing of tweens
support for sequencing tweens of a single variable
